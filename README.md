Imagine how dangerous it would be if someone drives a car without knowing the rules of how to behave on the road. Similarly, many of us go about living our lives as citizens without knowing our rights and duties. The Constitution is this living breathing document that has all the rules that we have collectively agreed to. This project aims to simplify consumption of the Constitution.

Back in 2015, we had worked on a project with TheHindu and Vidhi Center to visualize the changes to the Constitution of India â€” [constitution-of-india.pykih.com](http://constitution-of-india.pykih.com)
